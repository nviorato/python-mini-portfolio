# Python Starter Projects – By Nathalie

Welcome to a small collection of beginner Python projects focused on creativity, interactivity, and thoughtful user experiences. Each project is built using core Python concepts such as input/output, conditional logic, functions, and randomness. While the programs are simple, they reflect clean structure, real-world application, and intentional design.

## Projects Included

### 1. **Encouragement App**
A mood-based encouragement console app. The user enters their name, selects how they're feeling, and chooses between receiving an affirmation or a scripture. The app then provides a personalized, randomized message based on their emotional state.

**Key Concepts Used:**
- User input and string formatting  
- Dictionaries for categorized messages  
- Lists and `random.choice()`  
- Conditional logic and functions  

---

### 2. **Rock, Paper, Scissors**
A playful console game where the user competes against the computer in a classic round of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Includes simple ASCII visuals and full outcome logic.

**Key Concepts Used:**
- Input handling and branching logic  
- Random number generation with `randint`  
- Visual formatting using multi-line strings  
- Game condition evaluation using `if/elif` statements  

---

### 3. **BMI Calculator**
A practical tool that calculates and interprets a user's Body Mass Index based on their weight and height in imperial units. It returns the user's BMI along with a friendly classification.

**Key Concepts Used:**
- Float conversion from user input  
- Arithmetic operations  
- Conditional classification (`if/elif/else`)  
- Health-focused use case

## About This Repository
This project set marks the beginning of my coding journey. While I'm early in the process, I’ve focused on writing clean, readable, and purposeful code. These projects are designed to demonstrate a foundational understanding of Python and a curiosity for real-world applications that bring small moments of value, fun, or encouragement.

## Future Plans
I plan to expand on these projects by incorporating:
- File saving and journaling features  
- Graphical interfaces using Tkinter or PyQt  
- Data visualization and tracking  
- More modular and scalable code structures
